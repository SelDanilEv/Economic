('Know Your Money Priorities','You need a focus to align your money goals with your money habits. That focus is what’s most important in your life, right now.'),
('Determine Your Monthly Pay','As the saying goes, “what gets measured, gets managed.” How can you manage your money without knowing what you earn each month? If you don’t have a concrete number, determine your monthly income after taxes.'),
('Track where spends ','Time to play detective with your own finances. In order to get the full picture of your spending habits, you’ll need to do some financial forensics on yourself. If it seems overwhelming, limit yourself to one month’s worth of expenses.'),
('Have a Plan','Now that you know how much you earn, as well as how much you spend, it’s time to make a plan. The best financial plans align your priority with your spending habits.'),
('Stick to the Plan','Once you pick a plan, give it a try for at least a month. You need that long to see if it works for you. Anything less, and you won’t see the benefit of keeping an eye on your finances.'),
('Expect Emergencies','You never know what might happen. You or a partner could lose a job, or have a medical emergency or any number of circumstances. Whether you like it or not, life happens.'),
('Save Early and Often','This rule holds true regardless of your current priority. The sooner you save, the sooner you can build interest. You don’t even need an investment account to start earning interest.'),
('Take Advantage of Free Money','You don’t want to overlook what assets are available to you. If your employer offers, you should absolutely take advantage of the benefit. It’s free money.'),
('Relook Your Debt','Take a look at your total debt. Is there anything you can refinance for a lower rate? Maybe it’s transferring a balance to a credit card with lower interest. Or, it’s consolidating student loans. It’s worth combing through your debt with a fine tooth comb to see if you can find a way to save.'),
('Find What Works','Another common maxim that applies to money management is “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” Once you find a system that works, don’t get distracted by new apps or conflicting financial advice.')
